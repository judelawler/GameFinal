## Adventure Game Final

This Adventure Game is a brief journey through a dungeon; you must make your way through the dungeon's three rooms before you emerge on the other side of a mountain. 

The game will give you a set of options in each room, and at several points you will have to fight an enemy to be able to continue - if you are able to make it through all three rooms without dying, you will win, but if your HP drops to 0, you will lose.

No outside tools were used in the creation of this project other than the few imported classes. 

I contributed to this project by writing the majority of the game's code and by planning how the game would be structured.

To run this game, you will need to download the java files and run Game.java.
